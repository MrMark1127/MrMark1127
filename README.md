# Portfolio Website
I am actively developing a website that will host my resume and projects alike but instead of developing it in Flask I have decided to remake the website entirely with Tailwinds and React, so in the meantime please feel free to have a look at my most recent project below!

### Latest Projects
My most recent React project [@Mkeefeus](https://github.com/mkeefeus) and I built for our FiveM Server takes a front-end loaded in-game and communicates with a LUA backend to create items in the game based on the player's current inventory. This is the web-only version with an inventory pre-set stored in the assets folder. Red text means the player does not have enough items in their inventory.

A fun aptitude exercise, organizing a data set [(Here)](https://mrmark11273.github.io/Pizza-exercise/orders.json) to show the most popular pizza topping comibnations listed and ordered.

This is an application advertisement website based on Tinder, but for dogs developed with full responsiveness for all available viewports.

This was just a fun javascript project to manipualte elements and practice with event listeners to create a neat online drum kit you can use by clicking the boxes or pressing the coordinated keys.  
https://mrmark1127.github.io/Drum-Kit/

A simple project messing around with logic of mini-games to implement into the FiveM server I've been developing for. The game is Simon, a color flashes, hit the color and move on to the next level then another color will flash and you must remember the previous pattern and click the new additional color as well.

## Other Projects and My Role in Them
### New Reign Roleplay
Having a look on my profile will reveal that I'm in the New Reign Roleplay organization, which is a group of friends who are developing custom content for a modified Grand Theft Auto 5 server fitted for a roleplay community. This is a passion project of mine because it involves working behind a custom framework and learning the ins-and-outs of said framework. My role on this project is to learn from the lead developer and use what is taught to branch off and create my own custom content. As of now, I have created a customized hunting script that handles the player's inventory, checks multiple items before, during and after the "job" begins.
