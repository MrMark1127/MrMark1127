# MrMark1127
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MrMark1127, but I normally go by Mark!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently employed as a Technical Service Desk Analyst who is interested in learning full-stack web development with a focus on integrating Python backend code.
- ðŸŒ± My current endevour includes my working in Python with Flask along the use of a RESTful API for a custom music discovery application. On top of this, I'm really enjoying learning fullstack web development. I'm more familiar with backend development so I've shifted my focus towards really understanding JS based front-end development.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... If you've reached me via resume, my contact information can be found there.

## My Projects
### Portfolio Website
I'm currently developing a portfolio website that uses a CI/CD pipeline using Python and a Flask framework that will eventually host all of the links to my various projects as well as showing what I'm able to do both frontend and backend. Currently this website is not deployed but I do plan on having it public within the end of the week.

## Other Projects and My Role in Them
### New Reign Roleplay
Having a look on my profile will reveal that I'm in the New Reign Roleplay organization, which is a group of friends who are developing custom content for a modified Grand Theft Auto 5 server fitted for a roleplay community. This is a passion project of mine because it involves working behind a custom framework and learning the ins-and-outs of said framework. My role on this project is to learn from the lead developer and use what is taught to branch off and create my own custom content. As of now, I have created a customized hunting script that handles the player's inventory, checks multiple items before, during and after the "job" begins.
### Groove
With Groove, a group of friends and I, separate of the New Reign Roleplay team, are working on a music application that will allow users to discover new music like never before. With Groove, we will recommend music based on the input of the user, constantly being taylored more to what the user would like to see recommended based on several different factors, some of which include the genre, artist features and even the beat of the music itself. My role in this project is to develop a RESTful API to serve as the backend communication to our NextJS frontend application.
